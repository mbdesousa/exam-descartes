# Descartes - Mobile Challenge - React Native
Mateus Bernardo de Sousa

## Description
The challenge is to create a mobile application that allows users to access and view weather information for their current location as well as other locations. Users should be able to view the weather for the current day and subsequent days.

## Mandatory Requirements
1. Upon accessing the app, it should automatically retrieve the user's location and use it to fetch weather information.
2. Users should have the option to search for a specific address and view weather information for that location.
3. Display the weather information for the current day on a map. Place a marker on the map at the user's location or the selected address, and show weather details in a popup.
4. Weather information for other days should be presented in a separate section from the map.

## Observations
- You can develop the app using React Native.
- Use platform default UI components; third-party UI frameworks are not allowed.
- Utilize Google's API to obtain latitude and longitude for addresses.
- Choose a weather API of your preference.
- App design is open to your creative choices.

## Extras
1. Implement unit tests.
2. Allow users to click on the map to display weather information for that specific geolocation.
3. Consider using a mobile hybrid development platform (Cordova, MAUI, Xamarin) along with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React).

## Delivery Deadline
The project should be completed within 5 days.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Fulfill all mandatory requirements.
- Organize your code effectively.
- Evaluate the user experience (UX) - is the interface user-friendly and self-explanatory?

## Additional Notes
You can create a Comments.md or History.md file to document your thought process, including any challenges you faced, what worked, and what didn't work. Explain why certain decisions were made.

Feel free to host your challenge project on any repository manager (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.). This challenge is an opportunity for you to showcase your creativity.

If you have any questions, please reach out as soon as possible. Good luck!
